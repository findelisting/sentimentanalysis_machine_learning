# sentimentanalysis_machine_learning

This repository contains files to a sentiment analysis I conducted on Amazon Reviews. 
After the sentiment analysis, I explored the distribution of the reviews and compared them to get the overall picture of the feedback given by customers
Also, went further to conduct a random forest to determine the factors that contributed to a positive review (either the users, products or the seller).
